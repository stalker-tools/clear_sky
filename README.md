# Real Weapons mod for Clear Sky

Main purposes of this mod: weapons and ammos has real power, calculated from real manufacturer data sheets.

Clear Sky version: **1.5.10**

## Mod details

* The Actor and NPC are roughly equal at the Master game level. But If you have gameplay problems - set game level to _Novice_ and back to you favorite game level after.
* Weapons and ammos has real power, calculated from real manufacturer data sheets.

## Analysis

At first unpack origional _gamedata_ folder:
* Unpack game files to gamedata folder. See [Unpack gamedata](https://github.com/stalker-tools/tools/blob/main/analysis_cs.md) page.
* Copy original gamedata to `gamedata_orig`, for example. It used later to create .patch file.

### Generate NPC and weapons analysis html file
Use .ltx files analysis tools.
```sh
python graph_tool.py -f "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/clear_sky/gamedata" --head "NPC and weapons" > NPC_and_weapons.htm
```
Result: file NPC_and_weapons.htm (for example see _media/NPC_and_weapons.htm_ file).

### Ammo parameters graphs analysis

Look at graphs how unrealistic the ammo characteristics looks :astonished: ...

Main ammo parameter is power impulse: `k_hit` coefficient, it expressed as `1 = 300 Joules`. `1 Joule = (m * v^2) / 2` SI unit of kinetic energy. So to get bullet kinetic energy we need know bullet speed and bullet mass. To get this manufacturer data sheet files or wiki used.

Ammo tactical parameters:
* `k_hit` - bullet power coef
* `k_ap` - bullet ability to break through armor
* `k_dist` - distance coef
* `k_disp` - dispersion coef
* `k_pierce` - armor decrease coef
* `impair` - weapon barrel wear for one shoot
* `buck_shot` - count of bullet parts (buckshot shots)
* `wm_size` - visual size of the bullet hole on the surface
* `k_air_resistance` - air resistance of bullet coef

Weapon tactical parameters:
* `hit_power` - weapon power coef: Novice, Stalker, Veteran, Master
* `hit_impulse` - bullet to aim impulse
* `hit_type` - damage type: fire_wound, explosion
* `ammo_class` - ammo type list
* `fire_dispersion_base` - base angle of dispersion, degrees
* `cam_relax_speed`, `cam_relax_speed_ai` - return speed for player and AI
* `cam_dispersion`, `cam_dispersion_inc` - each shoot dispersion increase, degree; `cam_dispersion` each shot increase
* `cam_dispersion_frac` - barrel up for: `cam_dispersion * cam_dispersion_frac Â± cam_dispersion * (1 - cam_dispersion_frac)`
* `cam_max_angle` - max barrel vertical-up angle for shooting recoil
* `cam_max_angle_horz`, `cam_step_angle_horz` - max barrel horizontal angle; `cam_max_angle_horz` each shot increase
* `zoom_cam*` - like `cam_*` but for optical aiming and front sight
* `fire_dispersion_condition_factor` - dispersion increase on max wear, percent
* `misfire_probability` - probability of a misfire on max wear
* `misfire_condition_k` - misfire condition threshold
* `condition_shot_dec` - wear increase for each shot

`Damage = hit_power * k_hit`

## Create Real Weapons mod

### Edit .ltx files

Use python tools from **tools** repo.

### Create patch file `real_weapons.patch`:
```sh
diff -bur "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/clear_sky/gamedata_orig" "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/clear_sky/gamedata" > real_weapons.patch
```

To apply patch file `real_weapons.patch` to gamedata folder:
```sh
patch --verbose --directory=./gamedata/ --strip=1 < real_weapons.patch
```

### Create mod zip file
```sh
real_weapons_create_mod_zip.sh
```
